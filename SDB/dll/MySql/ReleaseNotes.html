<ul>

	<li>Renamed assembly to ByteFX.MySqlClient.dll</li>
	<li>Moved all design components into MySqlClient.Design</li>
	<li>Supporting 2,4, & 8 byte integer lengths from MySQL</li>
	<li>Better support for compression using the CompressedStream class</li>
	<li>Pooling now using the PING command to determine if MySQL is alive</li>

<UL>
  <LI>MySQL year datatype is now supported and handled internally as a 32 bit 
  integer</LI>

  connection string to enable this</LI>
  <LI>Parameters with values that were of type System.TimeSpan or System.Enum 
  are now handled correctly</LI>
  <LI>Improved connection string handling.&nbsp; Specifically, defaults are

  string while the connection is open.</LI>

  Common/StreamCreator that creates the appropriate stream based on 
  inputs.&nbsp; </LI>
  <LI>Speed is greatly improved due to better handling of network 
  connection.</LI>
  <LI>A pipe connection is now used when you specify Use Pipe=true on the 
  connection string.&nbsp; Note that this replaces the older method of selecting 
  pipes by specifying -1 as the port.</LI>
  <LI>Fixed some pooling bugs!!&nbsp; The provider should recover better from 
  closed or timed out connections.</LI>
  <LI>Much more testing!!</LI>
